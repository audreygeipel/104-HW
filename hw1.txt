Question 6 Part 1
3. This storage manager is problematic, because you can still have a pointer to a part of the buffer that is overwritten. This could happen is you alloc_char for two different sets of characters. If you then delete the first set, it will delete the whole buffer, but you will still have the pointer to the second set of chars. Then, if you allocate more chars and write over that, the pointer will be pointing to a random place in the buffer.
